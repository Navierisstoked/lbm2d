**This program focuses on the boundary condition treatment of lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). modified Filippova and Hanel method(thereafter as F-H model) has been added to this program.**

**a Matlab code is used to read a geometry picture, output 2 data files needed for LBM2d (indicator.dat and rate\_file.dat).**

**LBM2D will write data files in the finite element scheme, which can be read and presented by Tecplot.**
